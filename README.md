# Matrix Transpose and Multiplication using Verilog
Verilog implementation of matrix transpose and matrix–transpose multiplication for 2×2 and 3×3 matrices.


## Project Overview
This project implements matrix transpose and matrix multiplication of a matrix with
its transpose using **Verilog HDL**. The design supports both **2×2 and 3×3 matrices**
and demonstrates fundamental concepts of digital system design.


## Problem Statement
Design and implement a Verilog-based system to:
1. Compute the transpose of a given matrix
2. Compute the product of a matrix and its transpose



## Tools & Technology
- Verilog HDL
- Digital System Design concepts
- Simulation using HDL simulator



##  Design Description
- Input matrix elements are packed into a single vector
- Matrix elements are unpacked into 2D arrays
- Nested loops are used to perform:
  - Matrix transposition
  - Matrix multiplication
- Output vectors store the transpose and multiplication result



## Implementations
- **2×2 Matrix Transpose and Multiplication**
- **3×3 Matrix Transpose and Multiplication**

Each implementation includes:
- Verilog module
- Testbench
- Simulation results



## Results
Simulation waveforms verify:
- Correct transposition of the matrix
- Correct multiplication of the matrix with its transpose



## Conclusion
Matrix transposition and multiplication are fundamental operations in digital systems.
This project demonstrates an efficient Verilog-based implementation suitable for
hardware realization and educational purposes.
